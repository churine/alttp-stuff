patches for the different randomizers I guess?
not sure how broken they are

### heromode.ips
disables small heart recovery and doubles ALL sources of damage. Patch A affects other things covered by the randomizer's own harder modes, patch B doesn't change those

### bluewarps.ips
adds rng to agahnim and ganon for some reason. This was only tested in v7
